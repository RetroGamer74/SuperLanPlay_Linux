Welcome to Super Lan Play client for Linux.

# GUI Release

This program mainly requires graphic capabilities, so in this section will cover installation and run of the graphic version.

First you have to install a couple libraries. Just run this command.

``` 
sudo apt install libpcap0.8-dev libuv1-dev
``` 

When installation finished, you can download Super Lan Play client from this link:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/beg5ae0q3ny45e1/superlanplay.tar.gz?dl=0

![Download](Download.png?raw=true "Download")

Then you will see a popup like this. Use the default option to allow you to extract the file once finished. Take care you will have to do double click in the window when you go to extract it, so don't go so fast.

![Default Open](DownloadingFromBrowser.png?raw=true "Default Open")

Then click Open and wait for Download finished.

Then a new window will be shown.

![Default Extraction](ExtractNote.png?raw=true "Default Extraction")

When download finished open a Terminal. When Terminal is open, you will find the superlanplay.tar.gz file located in the Downloads folder. If you're in spanish language it will be 'Descargas'.

So run this command from Terminal:

```
cd /home/$USER/Downloads
```
